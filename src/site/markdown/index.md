### Alternatives

Alternatively to the wcm.io AEM archetype you can use these tools to set up new AEM projects:

* [Adobe AEM project archetype][adobe-aem-archetype] - Supports only FileVault package layout and the most recent AEM version
* [ACS AEM Lazybones Templates][acs-aem-lazybones] - Supports only FileVault package layout. Configuration is quite flexible regarding AEM versions and ACS AEM Commons usage.
